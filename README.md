## Personal Learnings 
For this project i made sure to go with a mobile first approach and it made my life so much more easier, also i should be commiting more regularly than commiting once i finished making a bunch of major changes. Every small change that looks good and works perfect i should commit right away and add beter commit messages for future reference.
